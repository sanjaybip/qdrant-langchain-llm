Mohan, a humble farmer, owned a piece of land where he grew crops to feed his family. One day, while tilling the soil, he stumbled upon a golden seed. Curious, he planted the seed, and to his astonishment, it grew into a magnificent mango tree with golden mangoes.

News of the golden mango tree spread throughout the village, and soon, everyone was at Mohan's doorstep, wanting to see the marvel. Mohan, being generous, gave away the golden mangoes to whoever asked, ensuring that no one left his home empty-handed. The mangoes, apart from being golden, were said to bring luck and prosperity to whoever possessed them.

Ramesh, Mohan's neighbor, driven by greed, coveted the tree. He thought to himself, "If I had that tree, I would be the richest man in the village." He plotted to steal the tree. One night, under the cover of darkness, Ramesh dug up the tree and planted it in his backyard.

The next morning, Mohan was devastated to find his tree missing. The entire village was in an uproar, and Ramesh, feigning innocence, acted equally shocked.

However, as days passed, the tree in Ramesh's backyard started to wither. The golden mangoes turned to ash, and the tree's leaves fell off. Ramesh was puzzled and distraught.

The elderly villager, sensing the situation, approached Ramesh and said, "The golden mango tree was a gift to Mohan for his pure heart and selflessness. It cannot thrive in a place where it's nurtured by greed."

Realizing his folly, Ramesh returned the withered tree to Mohan, apologizing for his actions. Miraculously, as soon as Mohan planted the tree back in its original place, it regained its vitality, bearing golden mangoes once again.

The villagers learned an important lesson that day - that greed not only harms others but also oneself. Mohan's generosity and Ramesh's subsequent redemption taught the village the value of honesty, contentment, and the perils of greed.

Moral of the story: Greed can never bring true prosperity; it's the purity of heart and selfless deeds that bring real wealth and happiness.
